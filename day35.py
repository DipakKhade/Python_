## for loop with else in python

#e.g
# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)

# else:
#     print('no i is found')              





# for i in range(6):
#     print(i)
#     if i == 4:
#         break                                    #    '''if we break the loop the else statement can not be executed'''
# else:
#     print('this is else in for loop')




#we can do same thing with while loop

i=0
while i<8:
    print(i)
    i=i+1

else:
    print('this is else in while loop')
