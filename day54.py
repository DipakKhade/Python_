# 'is' vs '==' in Python 

# a=4
# b='4'

# print(a is b)      # exact location of memory
# print(a==b)        #values

# a=[7,18]
# b=[7,18]

# print(a is b)      # exact location of memory
# print(a==b)        #values


a=4
b=4

print(a is b)      # exact location of memory
print(a==b)        #values
# since both are constants i.e immutables they are reffered as same in  momery
